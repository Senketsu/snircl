### About snircl
Personal IRC library for bots and onther ugly stuff i play with.
It's very much improved version of my C library written in Nim.
Parser courtesy of Nim's official irc lib.
It was good so i pretty much copied it to replace my regex shit from C's lib.

It's still just first draft but it works and its used in my projects.
Just hesitated to share it.
Enjoy ?..
